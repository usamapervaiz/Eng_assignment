The approach is comprised of following steps: <br>
a) Determine pair-wise intersections of lines (e.g., which line intersecting which line?) <br>
b) Construct an adjaceny matrix to represent this finite undirected graph. <br>
c) Clustering the adjaceny matrix to identify the number of total clusters. <br>

<b> Line-Line Intersection:</b> <br>

    
A linear Bezier curve can describe how far B(t) is from P0 to P1. Example given below: <br>

We can define any two lines intersection in terms of Bezier parameters (detailed mathematics in jupyter notebook).
